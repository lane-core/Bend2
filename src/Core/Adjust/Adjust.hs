-- # Core.Adjust
--
-- Converts a term to "Case-Tree" form. It has 3 main steps:
-- - FlattenPats : patterns become non-nested and single-scrutinee
-- - DesugarPats : patterns become native λ-matches
-- - ReduceEtas  : eta-reduces `λx.(λ{f} x)` into `λ{f}`
--
-- Example:
--
--   λa. λb. match a b { case 0n 0n: A ; case 0n 1n+bp: B ; case 1n+ap 0n: C ; case 1n+ap 1n+bp: D }
--   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FlattenPats
--   λa. λb. match a { case 0n: match b { case 0n: A ; case 1n+bp: B } case 1n+ap: match b { case 0n: C ; case 1n+bp: D } }
--   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DesugarPats
--   λa. λb. (λ{ 0n: (λ{ 0n:A 1n+:λbp.B } b) 1n+ap: (λ{ 0n:C 1n+bp:D } b)} a)
--   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ReduceEtas
--   λ{ 0n: λ{ 0n:A 1n+:λbp.B } 1n+ap: λ{ 0n:C 1n+bp:D }}
--
-- Note the final result is in "eta-reduced case-tree form".
--
-- # Eta-Reduced Case-Tree (ERCT) Form
--
-- A term is in ERCT form when it is a closed expression without any
-- sub-expression in the form `(λ{...} x)`. In other words, the term
-- can't contain a *lambda-match applied to an expression*.
--
--   (λ{...} x)
--
-- I.e., a lambda-match applied to an argument.
--
-- Bend represents top-level definitions as case-trees, since:
-- - It helps with equality termination (see guarded deref)
-- - It prevents goals being stuck in "hidden expressions"
-- - It prevents rewrites when type-checking eliminations
-- - It makes it suitable for fast search (BendGen)
-- - It generates efficient HVM programs
--
-- In general, the eta-reduced case-trees are very handy as an internal
-- representation, so we stick to them. Note that there are some top-level
-- definitions that *can't* be represented that way. For example, consider:
--
--   F = λa. λb. match b: { case 0n: if a: A else: B case 1n+p: if a: C else: D }
--
-- If we attempt to manually convert it to a case-tree, the best we get is:
--
--   F = λa. λ{ 0n: (λ{ True: A ; False: B } a) 1n+p: (λ{ True: C ; False: D} a) }
--
-- We can't progress further, because there is no way to eta-reduce it to
-- eliminate the internal `(λ{...} x)`. What we could do, though, is split
-- it into two top-level definitions instead:
--
--   F = λa. λb. G(b,a)
--   G = λ{ True: λ{ 0n: A ; 1n+p: C } True: λ{ 0n: B ; 1n+p: D } }
--
-- Flipping the arguments allow us to progress, because we eliminate inputs in
-- the same order they're received; i.e., a `Bool → Nat → P` function first
-- eliminates the Bool, and then the Nat. Every top-level definition can be
-- split into many top-level definitions that are in ERCT form. Currently, this
-- is *not* done yet, but must be implemented before the initial launch.
--
-- This file will also desugar forks into sups and dups. See DesugarForks.hs.
